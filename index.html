                             <p> Coming in at the top, FFIX is my favorite video game of all time. Whether it's due to nostalgia 
                             or being one of the first games I finished as a kid, it holds a special place in my heart. Memorable 
                             art style, a sountrack to enhance pivotal moments, a cast of characters that grow &amp; develop, as well 
                             as being the creator's favorite game created are just some reasons I believe it is the best of the Final
                             Fantasy series.</p>

                             </div>
                             <p> Next on our list is my number two favoirte game, Ori and the Blind Forest. This game is absoutely
                             beautiful. Described as metroidvanian, it follows in the footsteps of famous games like Metroid &amp; 
                             Mega Man but has hollowed out its own place among them. You follow the hero, Ori, as he tries to save 
                             the dying forest of Nibel.</p>

                        <div class = "section">
                         <h4 id="G1">Hades</h4>
                            <div class = "section3">
                            <h2 id = "hades"><img src = "Images/Hades.jpg" width = "550" height = "350"  alt = "Hades Title."></h2>
                            </div>
                             <p> Last but not least, my third favorted game is Hades. Being a huge fan of everything greek mythology 
                              there was not doubt that I was going to love the game. Unlike FFIX, a role playing game &amp; Ori, a 
                             metroidvanian, Hades is a roguelike, action role-play. You follow Zagreus, the prince of the Underworld as
                             tries to escape the relm and his father, Hades, to reach Mount Olympus.   </p>
